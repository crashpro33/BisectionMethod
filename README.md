# BisectionMethod

General Info: This is a function for the bisection method. It takes in a function, bounds, tolerance, and
%	maximum iterations and outputs the required iterations to find a root, the final bounds, and the root.
%	The method consists of repeatedly bisecting the interval defined by these values and then selecting the 
%	subinterval in which the function changes sign, and therefore must contain a root. 
%	It is a very simple and robust method, but it is also relatively slow.
